### ABOUT US

**Charity Map** ([www.charity-map.org](http://www.charity-map.org)) is an online crowdfunding platform to help facilitate transparent and reliable donations for charitable activities in Vietnam. 

Donors, especially those who have grown up in the Web Era (with the accessibility of information on the Internet), want more accountability in their dealings with non-profits. **Charity Map**, with our built-in financial management system, ensures donorsâ€™ experience with giving as enjoyable as possible. We track and visually present the flow of donation, from the point a donor enters his/her CC information, to the moment the fund is dispatched to a charitable project. The communication is direct and convenient; donors know where, when and whom their donations go to; project creators have a channel to report and response directly and individually to their supporters.

After successfully raising seed funding through a Princeton in Asia Carriebright grant, the organization is rapidly expanding and iterating to deliver high impact to underserved entities in Vietnam. We are looking for curious, highly efficient, hacker interns to work closely with us on our slick revamped platform.
